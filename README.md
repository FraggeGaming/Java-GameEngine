# AntZationEngine

Designed and implemented a custom ECS-based game engine layer on top of LibGDX, providing a Unity-style workflow through class-based systems (e.g., update, render, onCreate). Features include a spatial renderer using hash maps for camera-optimized rendering, sprite animation, collision detection, pathfinding, and multiplayer support.
